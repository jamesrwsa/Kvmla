## Start Small and Scale Gradually

The beauty of using a website as a vision board is that you don’t have to complete it all at once. Begin with a single page and expand over time. For instance:
- Create sections for different goals or departments.
- Use hidden pages for private brainstorming.
- Leverage public-facing landing pages to share progress with your audience.

Some entrepreneurs even keep their websites private while using tools like [**Leadpages**](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) for public landing pages. This approach allows you to visualize in private while maintaining a professional front for your audience.
