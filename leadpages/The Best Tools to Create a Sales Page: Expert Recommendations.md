## Why Your Sales Page Software Matters

The primary purpose of a sales page is to drive conversions. To achieve this, it’s critical to eliminate distractions like navigation bars or footers. Your sales page should focus solely on guiding the visitor toward making a purchase. Only in the case of very long sales pages should anchor links for internal navigation be used.
